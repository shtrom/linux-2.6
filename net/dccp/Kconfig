	  Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (RFC 4340)

	  From http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4340.txt:

	  The Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) is a transport
	  protocol that implements bidirectional, unicast connections of
	  congestion-controlled, unreliable datagrams. It should be suitable
	  for use by applications such as streaming media, Internet telephony,
	  and on-line games.

	  To compile this protocol support as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called dccp.

	  If in doubt, say N.

	  Support for Freeze-DCCP to temporarily freeze the data flows.
	  Options can be sent to freeze both sides' senders or restore the
	  operation with a faster adaptation to the new conditions.
	  This can be used e.g. when the a mobile node and predicts a
	  disconnection to avoid losing packets.

	  Currently only implemented for TFRC (CCID3) [0].

	  Only use this if you're hacking DCCP.

	  When compiling DCCP as a module, this debugging output can be toggled
	  by setting the parameter dccp_debug of the `dccp' module to 0 or 1.

	This module allows for capturing the changes to DCCP connection
	state in response to incoming packets. It is used for debugging
	DCCP congestion avoidance modules. If you don't understand
	what was just said, you don't need it: say N.

	Documentation on how to use DCCP connection probing can be found
